GhostContainers is a modern, feature-rich Docker container management application with a clean GUI interface, plugin system, and custom Docker API implementation that eliminates external dependencies.

**Think of it as a Qubes OS-inspired security architecture built on Docker** - providing isolated, compartmentalized environments that can run anywhere Docker is available. Unlike Qubes OS which requires specific hardware and Xen hypervisor, GhostContainers brings the same security-through-isolation philosophy to any platform supporting Docker (Linux, macOS, Windows), making advanced container isolation accessible and portable.
